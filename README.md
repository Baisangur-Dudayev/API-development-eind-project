# API Project
This is my project for API development. The theme is about books. There are authors, books, pen names. In total there are 10 endpoints: 4 get's, 4 Post's & 2 Delete's. I have done all the minimum requirements (number 1.) and I have done a few front-end requiremnts (numbers 3.1, 3.1.1, 3.1.2).

## Frontend

The frontend of this project is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can access it [here](https://api-development-eind-frontend.netlify.app/).

## Okteto Development Environment

I utilized Okteto for development. The API documentation is available at [Okteto - API Documentation]([https://api-development-eind-frontend.netlify.app/](https://useritem-api-service-eindproject-baisangur-dudayev.cloud.okteto.net/docs#/)).
